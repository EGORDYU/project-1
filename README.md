# Panda Bub Me

## The general idea


You play as a panda who woke up all alone in another part of his region. He must get back to his home, but there are enemies between him and his goal. Your goal is to dodge projectiles while the 30 second timer runs down. If you live with any lives you beat the level.

## MVP

* Have a game screen with a start button and instructions
* One type of enemy
* Movement for central panda Up-Down, Left-Right
* Dodge for 30 seconds to win
* Getting hit by projectile loses 1 life
* Three lives lost and game ends
* Have one stage


## Stretch Goals
* Have text show up that panda god is holding and be able to type it in
* Typing in 5 correct prompts wins the game
* Game screen with current level and amount of lives for panda
* Have the air units move left and right
* Have the panda roll around when moving left and right
* 3+ stages
* 3rd type of enemy
* sound effects
* three wrong typing attempts results in one life being lost

## Potential Roadblocks
* canvas is new to me and it will take me a little to figure out
* the animations could be difficult
* disorganized code as I imagine I will have to collect a lot of things
* having projectiles lock onto the initial position of the player and fire there
